# Updating the IRI

The IRI is in a beta development stage, meaning that it is likely to change.

When a new version of the [IRI is released on GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases), we recommend that you update your local IRI to the new version.

1. Either [download the latest IRI for Linux](/how-to-guides/downloading-the-iri-on-linux.md) or [download the latest IRI for Docker](downloading-the-iri-from-a-docker-container.md)
2. Delete the mainnetdb folder and the mainnet.log file
3. [Run the IRI](/how-to-guides/running-the-iri.md)
