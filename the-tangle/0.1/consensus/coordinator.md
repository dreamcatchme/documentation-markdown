# The Coordinator

The coordinator is an entity controlled by the IOTA Foundation, which issues

zero-valued transactions every two minutes, called a _milestone_. Using the

coordinator, the definition of consensus is simple: any transaction referenced

by a milestone is confirmed, and the others are not.
