## AstroPiOTA

AstroPi flies onboard the International Space Station (ISS) keeping astronauts update-to-date about their environment.  AstroPi was made with a Raspberry Pi computer coupled with Sense HAT to sense temperature, humidity, and other data.    

AstroPiOTA is a clone of AstroPi hooked to MAM for keeping track of local environment data using the Tangle.  Here on earth, AstroPiOTA helps us understand and report local weather and may aid in earthquake prediction.  MAM is a subscription service.  Subscribe to the AstroPiOTA channel and get the lastest data.  The Tangle is a distributed ledger useful for storing AstroPiOTA data in a way that subscribers can use it for analysis.

## Environment Data

Sense Hat has an IMU which stands for Inertial Measurement Unit.  It includes:

- Temperature and humidity sensors
- Barometric Pressure sensor
- Accelerometer that measures acceleration forces
- Gyroscope that measures momentum and rotation
- Magnetometer that measures the Earth’s own magnetic field, a bit like a compass

Some IMU data is measured using [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) where:

        x is roll or rotation about the x-axis
        y is pitch or rotation about the y-axis
        z is yaw or rotation about the z-axis
        

MAM sends Sense HAT message data in this json format:
